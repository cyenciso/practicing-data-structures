# Properties
- list of sequential nodes that reference neighboring nodes
- can be circular
- used in other data structures
- has a head and tail
- can be singly or double linked
		- singly linked uses less memory
		- singly linked is simpler
		- doubly linked can be traversed backward
	
# Complexity
**Singly Linked List**
- Search: O(n)
- Insert/remove at head: O(1)
- insert at tail: O(1)
- Remove at tail: O(n)

**Doubly Linked List**
- Search: O(n)
- Insert/remove at head: O(1)
- insert/remove at tail: O(1)
